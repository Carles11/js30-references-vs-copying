    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const teams = players;
    console.log(players, teams)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    teams[3] = "Carles"

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players]
const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
team5[3] = 'cool'
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
const captain = person;
captain.age = 99;
console.log("PERSON_AGE",person.age)
console.log("CAPTAIN_AGE",captain.age)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age:17})
console.log("CAP2", cap2)
console.log("PERSON", person)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
const cap3 = {...person, mobile: 'huawei', laptop: 'hp'}
console.log("CAPTAIN3", cap3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
